# Election Fraud Analysis

The .csv files here are what I used to conduct my analysis of so-called voter fraud using the NYT/"Edison" data that had been leaked by anonymous coders on Twitter. 

'nyt_hr2_night_public.csv' is the cleaned version of the file that has some of the variables I added. 

'asorted_NEW_full_data_hour' and 'nyt_ts' are versions of the file that I worked with, but not the final one I wanted to share with the public. You can ignore them.

'nyt_ts (1)' is the version of the file that I downloaded from anonymous coders, as provided in the tweet thread by @APhilosophae. There is no way to verify if the file is real.
